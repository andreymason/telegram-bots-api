# Telegram Bot API

This project aims to create a simple HTTP server using FastAPI for building an API to interact with Telegram bots. It facilitates sending messages to a Telegram bot and receiving responses, essentially serving as an API for interacting with any Telegram bot.

## Installation and Usage

1. **Obtaining API credentials for Telegram**

   - Sign up for Telegram using any application.
   - Log in to your Telegram account: [https://my.telegram.org](https://my.telegram.org).
   - Go to "API development tools" and fill out the form.
   - You will receive basic addresses as well as the api_id and api_hash parameters required for user authorization.
   - Currently, each number can only have one api_id connected to it.

2. **Setting up the .env file**

   - Create a file named .env in the root of the project.
   - In the .env file, specify values for API_ID and API_HASH obtained in the previous step:
     ```
     API_ID="your_api_id"
     API_HASH="your_api_hash"
     ```

Here's the revised section for setting up the virtual environment using `python3 -m venv venv`:

3. **Setting up the virtual environment / Installing dependencies**

   - Create a virtual environment using Python's built-in venv module:
     ```
     python3 -m venv venv
     ```
   - Activate the virtual environment:
     - On Windows:
       ```
       venv\Scripts\activate
       ```
     - On Unix or MacOS:
       ```
       source venv/bin/activate
       ```

   Ensure you have activated the virtual environment. Then run the following command to install the project dependencies:

   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

This revised section provides instructions for setting up the virtual environment using Python's venv module and installing dependencies from the requirements.txt file.

4. **Running the application**

   Start the HTTP server using uvicorn:

   ```
   uvicorn main:app --reload
   ```

5. **Usage**

   - Find the bot in Telegram that you want to interact with.
   - Send it a message.
   - Get the bot's ID using @username_to_id_bot.
   - Now you can send requests to the bot with commands using the following URL format:
     ```
     http://127.0.0.1:8000/?chat_id=your_chat_id&text=your_command
     ```
  
     Example request:
     ```
     http://127.0.0.1:8000/?chat_id=292972715&text=/help
     ```
     ```json
      {
          "message": "üåé Please select a language.",
          "date": "04-02-2024 11:46:23",
          "replies": [
              "üá¨üáß English",
              "üá™üá∏ Espa√±ol",
              "üá∑üá∫ –†—É—Å—Å–∫–∏–π"
          ]
      }
     ```

## Notes

- Please ensure you comply with Telegram API usage rules to avoid getting your account blocked.
