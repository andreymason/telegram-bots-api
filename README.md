# Telegram Bot API

This project aims to create a simple HTTP server using FastAPI for building an API to interact with Telegram bots. It facilitates sending messages to a Telegram bot and receiving responses, essentially serving as an API for interacting with any Telegram bot.

## Installation and Usage

1. **Obtaining API credentials for Telegram**

   - Sign up for Telegram using any application.
   - Log in to your Telegram account: [https://my.telegram.org](https://my.telegram.org).
   - Go to "API development tools" and fill out the form.
   - You will receive basic addresses as well as the api_id and api_hash parameters required for user authorization.
   - Currently, each number can only have one api_id connected to it.

2. **Setting up the .env file**

   - Create a file named .env in the root of the project.
   - In the .env file, specify values for API_ID and API_HASH obtained in the previous step:
     ```
     API_ID="your_api_id"
     API_HASH="your_api_hash"
     ```

3. **Setting up the virtual environment / Installing dependencies**

   - Create a virtual environment using Python's built-in venv module:
     ```
     python3 -m venv venv
     ```
   - Activate the virtual environment:
     - On Windows:
       ```
       venv\Scripts\activate
       ```
     - On Unix or MacOS:
       ```
       source venv/bin/activate
       ```

   Ensure you have activated the virtual environment. Then run the following command to install the project dependencies:

   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Running the application**

   Start the HTTP server using uvicorn:

   ```
   uvicorn main:app --reload
   ```
   
  Alternatively, you can create a systemd service in Linux to manage the application and automatically start it on boot:

  - Create a systemd service file. For example, create a file named `telegram_bot_api.service` in the directory `/etc/systemd/system/`:

    ```
    sudo nano /etc/systemd/system/telegram_bot_api.service
    ```

  - Add the following content to the file, adjusting the paths as necessary:

    ```
    [Unit]
    Description=Telegram Bot API HTTP Server
    After=network.target

    [Service]
    User=your_username
    Group=your_group
    WorkingDirectory=/path/to/your/project
    ExecStart=/path/to/venv/bin/uvicorn main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000
    Restart=always

    [Install]
    WantedBy=multi-user.target
    ```

    Replace `your_username`, `your_group`, `/path/to/your/project`, and `/path/to/venv/bin/uvicorn` with the appropriate values for your system.

  - Save the file and close the editor.

  - Reload systemd to load the new service file:

    ```
    sudo systemctl daemon-reload
    ```

  - Start the service:

    ```
    sudo systemctl start telegram_bot_api
    ```

  - Enable the service to start automatically on boot:

    ```
    sudo systemctl enable telegram_bot_api
    ```

  Now the Telegram Bot API HTTP Server will be managed by systemd, allowing you to start, stop, and restart it using systemd commands (`systemctl`). Additionally, it will start automatically on boot.

5. **Multiple Conversations**

   - By creating separate chat groups, you can have multiple conversations with the bot simultaneously.
   - Use the `/authorize` endpoint to create a new chat group with the bot user and obtain the group ID.
   - Use the obtained group ID in the requests to send messages to the bot in that specific group.

6. **Usage**

   To begin, you need to create a separate chat for isolated communication with the bot:

   - Use the `/authorize` endpoint to create a new chat group with the bot. This will generate a unique group ID for the chat:

     ```
     GET /authorize
     ```

     Example response:
     ```json
     {
       "group_id": 4147886708
     }
     ```

   Once you have obtained the group ID, you can use it to send requests:

   - Send requests to the bot using the following URL format:

     ```
     https://example.site/?group_id=your_group_id&text=your_command
     ```

     Example request:
     ```
     https://example.site/?group_id=4141332086&text=/start
     ```

     Example response:
     ```
      {
        "message": "Hi! I'm a translator @perebot âœ‹\n\nI will automatically translate messages in this group. To manage the bot, we recommend using the /settings command (it is also always available in the bot menu for administrators)\n\nReplacement bot: @ perevod_bot, channel.",
        "date": "04-16-2024 11:17:58",
        "replies": [
          "âœ… Translate everything"
          "Except Russian"
          "Stop (pause)",
          "Go to bot"
          "ðŸ†“ Learn English for free",
          "Add to another chat"
        ]
      }
     ```

     You can use either the `text` parameter to send text messages or the `button` parameter (int) to specify the index of the button to press. 

     If you send a request like `https://example.site/?group_id=4141332086&button=0`, you will press the button âœ… Translate everything. Please note that if you simultaneously send both `button` and `text` parameters in the request, nothing will happen. Only one parameter should be used at a time.


## Notes

- Please ensure you comply with Telegram API usage rules to avoid getting your account blocked.
